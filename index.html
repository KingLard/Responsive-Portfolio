                <p id="topParagraph">My name is Brett Landes, I am 20 years old and I live in North Carolina. I have been studying web design since
                high school. In my free time, I keep and breed multiple different species of reptiles. I enjoy working with these animals and helping create breeding programs to
                assure the stability of the species. I currently work with 2 species of geckos that are listed as threatened due to habitat loss and
                illegal pet trade. My goal is to breed these species in captivity to eliminate the need to pull them out of the wild.
                </p>
            
            
                <p>In my time studying Web development, I have focused solely on front-end development and I am excited to learn about back-end development.</p>

                <p>I have 3 snakes and over 20 geckos, for a total of 7 different species throughout my collection.</p>
